# mips

## todo

* generate rotation matrices

* matrix multiplication ( 3 loop iterations, probably faster to do it flat)

* add comments to drawing section

* fix lines drawing one iteration too far

* think up some clever sequence to draw the contour only (different colours maybe?)

* add user input 

* remove or fix the prints in the last section
