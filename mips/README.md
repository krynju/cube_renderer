FIXED VERTICE TRANSFORM
-- do something about static memory
vertex transform loop can be changed into load full matrix to registers and not
use another byte space to store the results


* generate rotation matrices -done

* matrix multiplication ( 3 loop iterations, probably faster to do it flat)

* add comments to drawing section	- done

* fix lines drawing one iteration too far	- done

* think up some clever sequence to draw the contour only (different colours maybe?)	- done, add color later

* add user input 

* remove or fix the prints in the last section 	- removed
